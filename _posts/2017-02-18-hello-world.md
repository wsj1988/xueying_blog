    从明天起，做一个幸福的人
    喂马、劈柴，周游世界
    从明天起，关心粮食和蔬菜
    我有一所房子，面朝大海，春暖花开

    从明天起，和每一个亲人通信
    告诉他们我的幸福
    那幸福的闪电告诉我的
    我将告诉每一个人
    给每一条河每一座山取一个温暖的名字
    陌生人，我也为你祝福
    愿你有一个灿烂的前程
    愿你有情人终成眷属
    愿你在尘世获得幸福
    我只愿面朝大海，春暖花开

    Grooming,chopping and traveling all over the world.
    From tomorrow on,I will care foodstuff and vegetable.
    Living in a house towards the sea, with spring blossoms.
    From tomorrow on,write to each of my dear ones.
    Telling them of my happiness.
    What the lightening of happiness has told me.
    I will spread it to each of them.
    Give a warm name for every river and every mountain.
    Strangers,I will also wish you happy.
    May you have a brilliant future!
    May you lovers eventually become spouses!
    May you enjoy happiness in this earthly world!
    I only wish to face the sea, with spring blossoms.
